Optimization 1:
Instead of using pragma to generate
Old version:

#pragma omp parallel for num_threads(thread_count)
for (int i = y1; i < y2; ++i)
{
	for (int j = x1; j < x2; ++j)
	{
		assignDirection(img, i, j);
	}
}

Optimized version:

#pragma omp parallel num_threads(thread_count) 
{
	#pragma omp for
	for (int i = y1; i < y2; ++i)
	{
		for (int j = x1; j < x2; ++j)
		{
			assignDirection(img, i, j);
		}
	}
}

This optimization, saved the system from forking same number of threads for each iteration. Thus gaining us around 10 - 15% performance.

Optimization 2:

Instead of using 2d arrays, I used 1d array with 2d mappings. This netted around %80 performance gain on both serial and parallel code.
